# Project-K README

## Overview

**Project-K** is a web-based platform aimed at facilitating collaborative learning, Learning platfrom inspired by the UI of Instagram, and Solar graph. The project is structured around three main modules:

- **Collaborative Coding Platform**: A Q&A-style interface inspired by Stack Overflow to assist with technical problem-solving.
- **Courses Module**: Provides access to various programming courses for learners of different levels.
- **Solar Energy Graph**: Visual representation of solar energy generation using real-time data visualization.

## Project Structure

The project comprises the following core components:

### 1. Collaborative Coding Platform
- Features a UI resembling Q&A forums like Stack Overflow.
- Users can browse questions related to programming issues, view details, and see tags.
- Implemented with a grid layout to display multiple questions, votes, and tags.

**Files**:
- `collaborative coding platform.html`

**Key Features**:
- Display of questions and answers.
- Tags for categorization.
- Side navigation for accessing different parts of the project.

### 2. Courses Module
- Offers users a variety of programming and development courses.
- Each course comes with a description, an image, and a link to access the content.
- Courses include topics such as Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and more.

**Files**:
- `courses.html`

**Key Features**:
- Grid layout to showcase different courses with course title, image, and details.
- External links to the full courses on platforms like Coursera and Udemy.

### 3. Solar Energy Graph
- Presents real-time data about solar energy generation.
- Graph built using Chart.js to show energy generation throughout the day.
- Includes a simple UI for users to switch between different time frames.

**Files**:
- `solargraph.html`

**Key Features**:
- A line chart that shows solar energy generation data for a specific day.
- Buttons to switch between daily and monthly views (month view not implemented yet).
- Responsive graph design for viewing on different devices.

## Installation

To run the project locally:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the HTML files in a modern web browser.
3. Use VS code Live server for better rendering of UI.

## Usage

- **Collaborative Coding Platform**: Navigate to `collaborative coding platform.html` to browse programming questions and learn from the discussions.
- **Courses Module**: Navigate to `courses.html` to explore different programming courses and access external resources.
- **Solar Energy Graph**: Navigate to `solargraph.html` to view solar energy generation data visualized with charts.

## Dependencies

- **Chart.js**: Used for rendering the solar energy generation graph.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic web components to build the interface and navigation.
